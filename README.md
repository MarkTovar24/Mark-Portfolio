# My Portfolio!

## Initial Project
- Recieved zero base code
- Instructed to create a simple portfolio webpage from scratch
- webpage must include working links, buttons and UI scrolls

## What I did

- Added HTML structure with semantics
- Used proper selectors in the html for effective CSS styling
- Added photos and placeholder photos for the "work" section
- Added working links, buttons and UI scrolls
- Made sure that the "Contact" section works properly.
